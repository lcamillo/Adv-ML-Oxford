# Variational auto encoder: a numpy implementation

This implmentation was modified from the code provided in the following

[https://github.com/y0ast/Variational-Autoencoder/tree/5c06a7f14de7f872d837cd4268ee2d081a90056d](https://github.com/y0ast/Variational-Autoencoder/tree/5c06a7f14de7f872d837cd4268ee2d081a90056d)

Usage: download the [FreyFace](https://github.com/y0ast/Variational-Autoencoder/blob/master/freyfaces.pkl) 
data and make sure it's named freyface.pkl. Put that to the same folder as the
numpy codes. Then run

```
python train_freyface.py
```

To see different techniques, edit the import area in train_freyface.py.
